# Time Series Analysis and Prediction for Energy Consumption and Renewable Energy
**Introduction**
This project focuses on conducting a comprehensive analysis of energy consumption (EC) and the integration of renewable energy (RE) sources in the United States between the years 2013 and 2023. The data for this analysis was sourced from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), a reliable and authoritative platform for energy-related data. Our primary goal is to provide insights into how EC trends have evolved over the specified decade, as well as the growth and adoption of various RE sources within the country.
**Rationale**
In an era driven by big data and advanced analytics, we recognize the power of machine learning (ML) to uncover intricate patterns and insights that traditional statistical methods might overlook. ML-driven analysis allows us to gain a deep understanding of the U.S. energy landscape, including sector-wise energy usage and RE adoption patterns. By leveraging this data-driven approach, we aim to provide valuable insights for policymakers, business leaders, and researchers, enabling them to make informed decisions, adjust policies, and allocate resources strategically to foster sustainable energy development.
**Data Source**
The dataset used in this project is obtained from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), a trusted and comprehensive source for energy-related data in the United States. This dataset encompasses a wide range of information related to energy consumption, renewable energy generation, and regional disparities, making it ideal for our analysis.
**Methodology**
Our research approach utilizes a mixed-methods approach with a primary focus on time-series analysis. Python, a versatile programming language, has been employed for data processing, analysis, and visualization. We have utilized Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to create compelling visualizations that highlight patterns and trends in energy consumption and renewable energy adoption.

To address the seasonal patterns in the data, we have implemented ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) methodologies for predictive modeling. A key aspect of our methodology is the 80-20 data split for training and testing, using monthly records spanning a ten-year period. Additionally, we have employed cross-validation techniques to mitigate potential overfitting issues.
**Key Findings**
Through our analysis, we aim to answer critical research questions:

How have energy consumption trends in the residential, commercial, industrial, and transportation sectors changed in the U.S. between 2013 and 2023, and what are the predicted future trends?
What has been the growth rate and generation output of various renewable energy sources (such as solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, and biomass) in the U.S. from 2013 to 2023, and what are the anticipated trends moving forward?
How do regional variations in the U.S. adoption of renewable energy compare, and what role do regional policies, resource availability, and local market conditions play in these differences?
**Conclusion**
This project aims to provide a comprehensive and data-driven analysis of energy consumption and renewable energy adoption in the United States. By leveraging machine learning techniques and reliable data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, we have explored critical trends and patterns that can inform decision-making processes, aid in the development of sustainable energy policies, and contribute to the global transition towards renewable energy sources. Our findings aim to be a valuable resource for researchers, policymakers, and industry leaders interested in the future of energy in the United States.
